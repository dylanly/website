        Hello! My name is Dylan Ly and I am currently a student attending the
        University of Washington - Seattle, intending to major in Computer
        Science & Engineering. <br>

        By attending the UW, I hope to learn more about myself and how I can
        make my impact on the world. I truly believe in the power of humility,
        a growth mindset, and optimism, and I use these qualities as my compass
        in my everyday life.<br>

        I believe that by strengthening my mental, emotional, and physical
        capabilities through adversity and life experiences, I can grow as a
        person and become someone that can fulfill his personal responsibilites,
        and eventually take on bigger challenges that burden my home, my
        community, and the world. <br>

        Let us keep our ideals lofty, our imagination unrestrained, our dreams
        ambitious and ask ourselves, "What if everything works out?"
